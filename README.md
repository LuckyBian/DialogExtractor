# DialogExtractor
DialogExtractor is a specialized tool designed to extract emotionally rich dialogues from audiobooks of novels. This project stems from the need to enhance Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems by providing them with high-quality, emotion-laden audio data, which is crucial for creating more expressive and realistic speech outputs.
